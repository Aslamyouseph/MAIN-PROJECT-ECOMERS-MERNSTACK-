But we'll cover the most common issues you'll face\r\n              assembling a desktop in 2023. You may decide to go fancier or more\r\n              budget-focused with your build, but you'll walk away with a great\r\n              grounding in what you need to know to do the job with\r\n              confidence.Today, PC builders are spoiled with such a wealth of\r\n              handsome, modestly priced PC cases, mood lighting options, and\r\n              color-coordinated components that it's easy to get pulled into a\r\n              design challenge or passion project when all you wanted to do was\r\n              build a simple desktop. To be sure, there's a hot-rodder element\r\n              here: You may pay a slight premium for your parts versus buying a\r\n              pre-built PC. Major PC makers enjoy economies of scale buying\r\n              parts in bulk or designing some of their own components that you\r\n              as a solo builder can't attain. But most of the time, if you price\r\n              out the parts for your own build against the cost of a ready-made\r\n              system, you should get pretty close.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"mainSection\">\r\n        <div className=\"card-row\">\r\n          <div className=\"card-image\">\r\n            <img src={image1} alt=\"Card Image\" />\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"card-content\">\r\n            <h5 className=\"card-title\">\r\n              How to Build a PC: The Ultimate Beginner's Guide\r\n            </h5>\r\n            <p className=\"card-text\">\r\n              PC building is infinitely varied, so no guide can cover every\r\n              scenario.
